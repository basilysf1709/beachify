## Test Plan: 

1. Testing the app in a real world senario, using test routes to make sure that it enhances the user experience
2. Testing the app and checking its scalability

## Future Improvements:

1. Redux state management. Normal unidirectional state management is difficult with different APIs.
2. Functional Polylines to get the direction from any latitude or longitude
3. Design Improvements: Improve the Restaurants Page.
4. Make transactions possible with Hedera.
